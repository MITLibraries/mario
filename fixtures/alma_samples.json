      "In A Common Table, Two Red Bowls blogger Cynthia Chen McTernan shares more than 80 Asian-inspired, modern recipes that marry food from her Chinese roots, Southern upbringing, and Korean mother-in-law's table. The book chronicles Cynthia's story alongside the recipes she and her family eat every day--beginning when she met her husband at law school and ate out of two battered red bowls, through the first years of her legal career in New York, to when she moved to Los Angeles to start a family. As Cynthia's life has changed, her cooking has become more diverse. She shares recipes that celebrate both the commonalities and the diversity of cultures: her mother-in-law's spicy Korean-inspired take on Hawaiian poke, a sticky sesame peanut pie that combines Chinese peanut sesame brittle with the decadence of a Southern pecan pie, and a grilled cheese topped with a crisp fried egg and fiery kimchi. And of course, she shares the basics: how to make soft, pillowy steamed buns, savory pork dumplings, and a simple fried rice that can form the base of any meal. Asian food may have a reputation for having long ingredient lists and complicated instructions, but Cynthia makes it relatable, avoiding hard-to-find ingredients or equipment, and breaking down how to bring Asian flavors home into your own kitchen. Above all, Cynthia believes that food can bring us together around the same table, no matter where we are from. The message at the heart of A Common Table is that the food we make and eat is rarely the product of one culture or moment, but is richly interwoven--and though some dishes might seem new or different, they are often more alike than they appear. -- Amazon."

      "Abiotic Stress Tolerance Related Genomics-assisted Breeding for Crop Improvement Volume 2 is a compilation of the status of genomics-assisted breeding in various crops in the era of high throughput genotyping and phenotyping platforms. How scientists have utilized these new platforms on their germplasm for identification of novel genes and alleles for abiotic stress tolerance is described. The articles in the book include topics specifically in the areas of genetics and genomics of stomatal traits for improving drought tolerance, genomics-based approaches for improving abiotic stress tolerance, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and association mapping for abiotic stress tolerance related traits and candidate genes for abiotic stress tolerance. In addition, chapters have been included on innovative role of double haploids in genomics-assisted crop improvement for abiotic stress tolerance. Overall, the collation will be very useful to scientists working in similar areas as well as to graduate and undergraduate students who want to get information of QTLs, genes etc. for a particular crop at one place."

      "The rate of heat extraction, hardness, and severity of quenching steel has been investigated using conventional and nonconventional methods. A variety of steel alloys such as 4140, D2, S7, and O1 were used in the preliminary tests with conventional quenching methods to observe the microstructures and hardness development. Results showed that as the cooling rate of the steel increase, the hardness of the steel increased. The microstructure of the conventional quenching methods were similar throughout the metal samples; air quenching produced larger grains of pearlite, ferrite, and cementite, oil quenching produced martensite and pearlite grains, and water quenching produced martensite. Afterwards, a further study was done with unconventional quenching methods on 1045 steel. The unconventional quenching methods that were studied included Olive Oil, Peanut Oil, Quench Fast, and Super Quench, quenchants which have been proliferated through blogs, online forums, and discussion boards. The results have shown that the unconventional quenching produces hardnesses greater than control samples. The quenching methods, however, within the range of 50 Vickers Hardness of each other, which is a small difference. Super Quench and water quench samples are within the standard deviation of their samples set from the hardness of each other similarly to Olive Oil and Quench Fast. Additionally the two groups of similar hardness had similar microstructures being composed of mainly martensite. It could be concluded that water and Olive Oil have the same effects as Super Quench and Quench Fast on 1045 steel respectively; therefore water and olive oil can be used as substitution providing a solution that are sustainable, nontoxic and quick to prepare. The metallurgical community has proliferated the use of unconventional quenching media as methods to yield superior results in steels. However, the results in this work show that the usage of different media rather than conventional quenching media, produce hardness and microstructures that are similar in value and composition. Therefore, there is no advantage to using quenching methods that have been advertised through blogs, online forums, and discussion boards."

      "Plant breeders and geneticists are under constant pressure to sustain and expand food production by using innovative breeding strategies and introducing minor crops, which are well adapted to marginal lands, provide a source of nutrition, and have abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, to feed an ever-increasing human population. The basic concept of this book is to examine the use of innovative methods augmenting traditional plant breeding towards the improvement and development of new crop varieties, under the increasingly limiting environmental and cultivation factors, to achieve sustainable agricultural production and enhanced food security. In addition to developing improved crops for innovative industrial products such as pharmaceuticals and food additives, biofuels, oils and textiles. Three volumes of this book series were published in 2015, 2016 and 2018, respectively: Volume 1. Breeding, Biotechnology and Molecular Tools; Volume 2. Agronomic, Abiotic and Biotic Stress Traits and Volume 3. Fruits. In 2019, the following four volumes are concurrently being published: Volume 4. Nut and Beverage Crops, Volume 5. Cereals, Volume 6. Industrial and Food Crops and Volume 7. Legumes. This Volume 4, subtitled Nut and Beverage Crops, focuses on advances in breeding strategies using both traditional and modern approaches for the improvement of individual plantation crops. Included in Part I, eleven important nut species recognized for their economical and nutritional importance including Almond, Argan, Brazil nut, Cashew nut, Chestnut, Hazelnut, Macadamia, Peanut, Pine nut, Pistachio and Walnut. Part II covers two popular beverage species, coffee and tea. Chapters are written by 53 internationally reputable scientists from 13 countries and subjected to a review process to assure quality presentation and scientific accuracy. Each chapter begins with an introduction covering related backgrounds and provides in-depth discussion of the subject supported with 108 high quality color figures, and relevant data in 55 tables. The chapter concludes with recommendations for future research directions, appendixes of genetic resources and concerned research institutes and a comprehensive list of pertinent references to facilitate further reading. This book series is a valuable resource for advanced students, researchers, scientists, commercial producers and seed companies as well as consultants and policymakers interested in agriculture, particularly in modern breeding technologies."

Add learning how to parent to this task, and you have a whole new experience for these expatriates. Yolande and Marie are two French moms learning how to raise their children to live in Southern California. Their counterparts, Heather, Dana, and Jason, are all Americans attempting the same task but in Paris, France. Peanut Butter et Confiture follows five expatriate parents on their individual journeys of learning to parent like the locals do. Each expat is at a different stage of acculturation and assimilation, and some are more expert expat parents than others. From struggling with the French language and suffering from parenting guilt, to learning how to deal with a sassy American seven-year-old, Yolande, Marie, Heather, Dana, and Jason are all learning as they go, and being raised by their foreign children along the way."

      "This book focuses on the utilization of bio-resources and their conversion pathways for a sustainable future. Tapping into bio-resources by means of thermochemical and biochemical processes has attracted researchers from all over the world; it is a broad area that has given birth to concepts like the biorefinery, as well as a new stream known as biotechnology. Its scope includes biochemical and microbiological engineering, biocatalysis and biotransformation, biosynthesis and metabolic engineering, bioprocess and biosystem engineering, bioenergy and biorefineries, cell culture and biomedical engineering, food, agricultural and marine biotechnology, bioseparation and biopurification engineering, bioremediation and environmental biotechnology, etc. The book discusses a host of new technologies now being used to tap these resources with innovative bioprocesses. All chapters are based on outstanding research papers selected for and presented at the IconSWM 2018 conference. ."

    "summary": [
      "In a Trance is just the sort of genre-defying work we at Peanut and punctum and, as it happens, Jeffrey Skoblow, revel in. It is a book-length essay by a fiction writer. It is a fictional essay by a literary scholar. It is a gallant assay by a smart man who thinks while he walks, and he walks a lot.The book is a meta-meditation on Paleolithic cave drawings and the humans who ponder them. It is fact-based and entrancing just as the cave drawings are actual (existing in time -- loosely -- and space -- more definitively) and mesmerizing. Skoblow is devising stories as \"we\" (humans) have always devised stories though in a less familiar mode, along a less travelled path.The essay draws on (!) the careful/thoughtful/whimsical notebooks kept by Skoblow over a dozen years. The notebooks record/illuminate/complicate his visits to twelve Paleolithic art sites as well as his deep, eccentric reading of texts concerned in some way with the subject of cave drawings by an array of scientists, anthropologists, archeologists, art historians, and other sundry enthusiasts and experts, so-called and otherwise.I saw the caves and didn't know what to do with them. So I started writing in Spring '01 to try to figure it out. The first words I wrote were \"The caves themselves.\" A few pages later: \"The caves, no doubt, blah blah blah. To find a way to talk about them: impossible.\" It wasn't going well.These are one man's marks made about making marks. Skoblow's meticulous descriptions attempt the impossible: to provide the \"information\" that will allow us to see what is visible, invisible, restricted, unseen, hidden, and lost (in the sense of not yet found, or destroyed, or degraded by human presence) beneath the ground at El Castillo and Niaux (for instance). Lines, dots, dashes, body parts, animals, and \"hum-animal\" figures -- things/creatures we have given name to (bison? rhino? vulva? phallus?) in our helplessly homo-sapien-centric attempts to understand (and/or to master our non-understanding).The Great Being would appear to be an androgynous figure, or rather, an ungendered figure almost mistakable for a skull, all the matter of a few deft lines: a slightly crumpled egg-shaped braincase with no representation of hair or other individualizing features, an overlarge eye and a blunt nose, a mouth curving in a long slow grin, maybe, of stupefaction or benediction, benign and spooky all at once.Here is a leaping mind.We follow Skoblow as he steps onto an electric train in the caves at Rouffignac and steps out in Southern Illinois, where he cautiously crosses a snake-ridden (maybe) meadow. This is where he meanders further -- literally and figuratively: further from the actual caves, furtherest from certainty. These furtherings are exactly what we might expect from a book that from its opening pages declares as one if its themes the difficulties inherent in considering Paleolithic art.It is problematic ... for reasons having to do with the nature of representation and, no doubt, the mysteries of sentient experience. There is also the problem of expectations and intent: to whom does one speak about the caves, and for what purpose?The pleasures of this book are found in Skoblow's intense, vigilant exploration of these problems and questions, which are in themselves irresistible. Who are we? In what ways, specifically, and to what degree do we resemble these ancient humans who spray- and brush-painted, smudged, carved, and stenciled images into and onto cave walls and floors and ceilings?Signs emptied of meaning, a kind of dream, a salve and a reassurance, possibly terrifying, too. A plunge into signs."

Written by internationally recognized researchers, this book covers and integrates worldwide literature in the field up to 2014, setting it apart from other books that are only of regional importance. The book focuses on major diseases of economic importance to each crop. Each chapter is devoted to a type of crop and a profile of affecting diseases according to geographical occurrence, epidemiology, symptoms, causal pathogens, host-pathogen interactions, biotechnological aspects, and the latest approaches to understanding host-pathogen interactions. It also includes discussions on developments on controversial subjects in research in order to stimulate thinking and further conversation with an eye toward improvements and resolutions.\"--"

    "summary": [
      "Many North American plants have characteristics that are especially promising for creating varieties needed to expand food production, and there are excellent prospects of generating new economically competitive crops from these natives. The inadequacy of current crops to meet the food demands of the world's huge, growing population makes the potential of indigenous North American food plants even more significant. These plants can also generate crops that are more compatible with the ecology of the world, and many also have inherent health benefits. Presenting detailed scholarship, a thoroughly accessible style, and numerous entertaining anecdotes, North American Cornucopia: Top 100 Indigenous Food Plants is a full-color book dedicated to the most important 100 native food plants of North America north of Mexico that have achieved commercial success or have substantial market potential. The introductory chapter reviews the historical development of North American indigenous crops and factors bearing on their future economic success. The rest of the book consists of 100 chapters, each dedicated to a particular crop. The book employs a user-friendly chapter format that presents the material in sections offering in-depth coverage of each plant. The first section of each chapter provides information on the scientific and English names of the plants, followed by a section on the geography and ecology of the wild forms, accompanied by a map showing the North American distribution. A section entitled \"Plant Portrait\" comprises a basic description of the plant, its history, and its economic and social importance. This is followed by \"Culinary Portrait,\" concerned with food uses and culinary vocabulary. The chapters then provide an analysis of the economic future of each crop, discuss notable and interesting scientific or technological observations and accomplishments, and present extensive references."

      "In a world increasingly challenged by the need to integrate and understand highly specialized knowledge in a multidisciplinary way, this book is innovative and perhaps unique in addressing this challenge. It focuses on ideas, strategies, techniques and practices spanning many disciplines at the interface of agriculture with: forestry, horticulture, plant physiology, genetics, ecology, soil science, food science, economics, and the social and environmental sciences as delivered by intensified and enriched agroforestry. Multifunctional Agriculture addresses this complexity, using case studies and insights from the needs of African farmers whose livelihoods are constrained by complex interactions between social, environmental and economic factors and problems underlying agricultural sustainability in Africa. This book, therefore, provides an important resource for those trying to understand the role of agriculture in the achievement of the new Sustainable Development Goals by providing easily implementable, practical and effective methodologies and practices."

      "Heterogeneity of the immune system has increasingly necessitated the use of high-resolution techniques, including flow cytometry, RNA-seq, and mass spectrometry, to decipher the immune underpinnings of various diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders. In recent years, high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has gained popularity among immunologists due to its ability to effectively characterize thousands of individual immune cells from tissues. Current techniques, however, are limited in their ability to elucidate essential immune cell features, including variable sequences of T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) that confer antigen specificity. Incorporation of TCR sequencing into scRNA-seq data could identify cells with shared antigen-recognition, further elucidating dynamics of antigen-specific immune responses in T cells. In the first part of this thesis work, we develop a strategy that enables simultaneous analysis of TCR sequences and corresponding full transcriptomes from 32 barcoded scRNA-seq samples. This approach is compatible with common 32 scRNA-seq methods, and adaptable to processed samples post hoc. We applied the technique to identify transcriptional signatures associated with clonal T cells from murine and human samples. In both cases, we observed preferential phenotypes among subsets of expanded T cell clones, including cytotoxic T cell states associated with immunization against viral peptides. In the second part of the thesis, we apply the strategy to a 12-patient study of peanut food allergy to characterize T helper cell responses to oral immunotherapy (OIT). We identified clonal T cells associated with distinct subsets of T helper cells, including Teff, Treg, and Tfh, as well as Th1, Th2, and Th17 signatures. We found that though the TCR repertoires of the patients were remarkably stable, regardless of their clinical outcomes, Th1 and Th2 clonotypes were phenotypically suppressed while Tfh clonotypes were not affected by therapy. Furthermore, we observed that highly activated clones were less likely to be suppressed by OIT than less activated clones. Our work represents one of the most detailed transcriptomic profiles of T helper cells in food allergy. In the last part of the thesis, we leverage the simplicity and adaptability of the method to recover TCR sequences from previously processed scRNA-seq samples derived from HIV patients and a nonhuman primate model of TB. In the HIV study, we recovered expanded clonotypes associated with activated T cells from longitudinal samples from patients with acute HIV infections. In the TB study, we modified the primers used in the method to T cells from TB granulomas of cynomolgus macaques. We identified not only expanded clonotypes associated with cytotoxic functions, but also clonotypes shared by clusters of activated T cells. In total, these results demonstrate the utility of our method when studying diseases in which clonotype-driven responses are critical to understanding the underlying biology."

In Lincoln Legends, noted historian and Lincoln expert Edward Steers Jr. carefully scrutinizes some of the most notorious tall tales and distorted ideas about America's sixteenth President."

      "More than Mom's apple pie, peanut butter is the all-American food. With its rich, roasted-peanut aroma and flavor; caramel hue; and gooey, consoling texture, peanut butter is an enduring favorite, found in the pantries of at least 75 percent of American kitchens. Americans eat more than a billion pounds a year. According to the Southern Peanut Growers, a trade group, that is enough to coat the floor of the Grand Canyon (although the association does not say to what height). Americans spoon it out of the jar, eat it in sandwiches by itself or with its bread-fellow jelly, and devour it with foods ranging from celery and raisins (\"ants on a log\") to a grilled sandwich with bacon and bananas (the classic \"Elvis\"). Peanut butter is used to flavor candy, ice cream, cookies, cereal, and other foods. It is a deeply ingrained staple of American childhood. Along with cheeseburgers, fried chicken, chocolate chip cookies (and apple pie), peanut butter is a consummate comfort food. In this book are the stories of Jif, Skippy, Peter Pan; the plight of black peanut farmers; the resurgence of natural or old-fashioned peanut butter; the reasons why Americans like peanut butter better than (almost) anyone else: the five ways that today's product is different from the original: the role of peanut butter in fighting Third World hunger: and the Salmonella outbreaks of 2007 and 2009, which threatened peanut butter's sacred place in the American cupboard. To a surprising extent, the story of peanut butter is the story of twentieth-century America, and the author writes its history, rich with anecdotes and facts culled from interviews, research, travels in the peanut-growing regions of the South, personal stories, and recipes."

      "\"One of the great myths of contemporary American culture is that the United States' food supply is the safest in the world because the government works to guarantee food safety and enforce certain standards on food producers, processors, and distributors. In reality U.S. food safety administration and oversight have remained essentially the same for more than a century, with the Pure Food and Drug Act and the Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906 continuing to frame national policy despite dramatic changes in production, processing, and distribution throughout the twentieth century. In Food We Trust is the first comprehensive examination of the history of food safety policy in the United States, analyzing critical moments in food safety history from Upton Sinclair's publication of The Jungle to Congress's passage of the 2010 Food Safety Modernization Act. With five case studies of significant food safety crises ranging from the 1959 chemical contamination of cranberries to the 2009 outbreak of salmonella in peanut butter, In Food We Trust contextualizes a changing food regulatory regime and explains how federal agencies are fundamentally limited in their power to safeguard the food supply.\"--"

      "\"Islam, Power, and Dependency in the Gambia River Basin draws on new sources to offer an original approach to the study of land in African history. Documenting the impact of Islamization, the development of peanut production, and the institution of colonial rule on people living along the middle and lower Gambia River, the book shows how these waves of changes sweeping the region after 1850 altered local political and social arrangements, with important implications for the ability of elites to control land. Author Assan Sarr argues for a nuanced understanding of land and its historic value in Africa. Moving beyond a recognition of the material value of land, Sarr's analysis highlights its cultural and social worth, pointing out the spiritual associations the land generated and the ways that certain people gained privileged access to those spiritual powers. By emphasizing that the land around the Gambia River both inspired and gave form to a cosmology of ritual and belief, the book points to what might be considered an indigenous tradition of ecological preservation and protection. Assan Sarr is assistant professor of history at Ohio University.\"--"

    "summary": [
      "In the early 1970s, Laura Bauer decides to leave college and head fifty miles north of her comfortable Atlanta home to manage a federally funded project aiding pregnant teenagers from the back roads of Appalachia. Almost as young as her clients, Laura is immediately confronted with--and almost overwhelmed by--a variety of young women in desperate circumstances, having no other source of prenatal care. When Nighttime Shadows Fall, Diane Michael Cantor's second novel, portrays the world of these girls with compassion, hardscrabble humor, and reverence for their families' capacities to prevail despite hardships. Among the characters are Mavis, a defiant, tough-as-nails preacher's daughter; Lisa, a victimized thirteen-year-old; Nell, a shy girl who is constantly berated by herdomineering mother; and self-conscious Mandy, whose proud husband, twice her age, detests any form of charity. As an outsider whose urban upbringing is vastly different from those of her clients, Laura must win their trust and overcome her own inexperience and the magnitude of the need she finds. The novel follows Laura as she struggles to locate her clients during their first trimesters, when they are still eligible for the project's services but often trying to conceal their pregnancies. As she overcomes their suspicions and tries to help them during those first critical months, Laura comes to realize she has prepared at least a few of them to open doors to their unexpected futures, just as they have helped her find the determination to face her own. When Nighttime Shadows Fall movingly portrays Laura's clients as they search for love from boyfriends, husbands, and babies. Some find it, but ultimately, through powerful revelations, their strength comes from within."

    "summary": [
      "\"As colonial development took off after the Second World War, in the context of national food shortages, Britain's Labour Government initiated the Groundnut Scheme, an extraordinarily ambitious project to convert 3 million acres of bush in Tanganyika into the largest mechanized groundnut farm in the world. It was to prove the largest, most expensive and most disastrous development scheme ever undertaken by the British Government. Never previously analysed in depth, the author draws on a wide range of sources to discuss the political dynamics that drove the Groundnut Scheme forward, despite the gravest doubts of agriculturalists and economists, why it went wrong, and what its impact has been since on the practice of economic development. Initially employing the United Africa Company as agent, the government set up an Overseas Food Corporation to manage the Groundnut Scheme as an example of socialist development in Africa. Army surplus kit and demobbed soldiers poured into the country and were sent up the railway line to Kongwa to beat the bush. By the time the effort was abandoned in 1950, costs had risen to a colossal 36 million - equivalent to over 1 billion today - and yet almost no groundnuts had been exported. The prototype of many large-scale, government-run, high-cost development projects that failed to deliver, the Groundnut Scheme was perhaps the first major failure of agricultural development in Africa, and its legacy in development practice still with us today. Nicholas Westcott is Director of the Royal African Society and Research Associate at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London. His previous posts include Managing Director, Middle East and North Africa, and prior to that Managing Director for Africa, European External Action Service (EU), Brussels. \"--Publisher description"

      "The double helix architecture of DNA was elucidated in 1953. Twenty years later, in 1973, the discovery of restriction enzymes helped to create recombinant DNA mol\u00ad ecules in vitro. The implications of these powerful and novel methods of molecular biol\u00ad ogy, and their potential in the genetic manipulation and improvement of microbes, plants and animals, became increasingly evident, and led to the birth of modern biotechnology. The first transgenic plants in which a bacterial gene had been stably integrated were produced in 1983, and by 1993 transgenic plants had been produced in all major crop species, including the cereals and the legumes. These remarkable achievements have resulted in the production of crops that are resistant to potent but environmentally safe herbicides, or to viral pathogens and insect pests. In other instances genes have been introduced that delay fruit ripening, or increase starch content, or cause male sterility. Most of these manipulations are based on the introduction of a single gene - generally of bacterial origin - that regulates an important monogenic trait, into the crop of choice. Many of the engineered crops are now under field trials and are expected to be commercially produced within the next few years."

      "The Apartment of Tragic Appliances, named as a finalist for a 2013 Lambda Literary Award, is a literal place in which a hapless, portable dishwasher \"heats residue only to reimagine cleanliness as an art project,\" a recalcitrant microwave neglects to heat, and a refrigerator dies an inconvenient, bulky death. It is also that psychic space in which we consider our loneliness, our wandering hearts, our unpacked boxes, our vulgar desires.In Queer Optimism: Lyric Personhood and Other Felicitous Persuasions (Minnesota, 2007), Michael Snediker worked \"in the interests of felicity\" to undermine the ways in which queer theory customarily privileges shame and melancholy. Here, in his first full-length collection of poetry, he undertakes a similar upending of expectation, acknowledging \"gay sadness\" but refusing to fall fully under its sway. The demi-tragedies of daily life are recounted by a voice that is variously wistful, giddy, bawdy, silly, and tart. Along the way, Michael Snediker sets off an impressive pyrotechnic display of literary allusion, drawing on the superstars of the Western canon (think: Virgil, Racine, Proust, James, Wharton, Tennessee Williams) and of popular culture (Lucille Ball, John Travolta, Alex Trebek).Buyer beware: In these pages you will not find advice on how to feng shui your duplex or tame a Cuisinart run amok. Instead, you will find something far rarer: a book of poetic sustenance. As Daniel Tiffany observes, \"We have been missing poems like these for a long time.”"

      "A peanut shelling machine was designed and built to help improve the standard of living of people in third world countries such as Ghana and Haiti. Two prototypes were built to test the concept of using a wheel as a peanut sheller. Peanuts would go through a gap between a spinning wheel and a hard friction channel and come out on the other side fully shelled. The peanut sheller was powered using a crank. Second prototype was built after the concept of the spinning wheel worked after: testing the first prototype. Peanuts were shelled without breaking the kernels however a separator mechanism still needs to be built to separate the kernels from the shells."

    "summary": [
      "Despite the problems with obesity that the United States is facing today, malnutrition, caused in part by severely low dietary fat consumption, remains a problem among many people living in Sub-Saharan Africa. According to the World Health Organization, one third of people in developing countries are malnourished as well as vitamin or mineral deficient. While villagers do not have access to commercially produced vegetable oil (a common source of dietary fat), nor are industrial scale oil extraction methods appropriate for small scale production. As a result, they turn to traditional methods, such as a mortar and pestle, to extract oil from peanuts, sunflower seeds, and other oil bearing seeds and nuts. This process is both time and labor intensive, and still does not yield sufficient amounts of oil to satisfy the need for it. The need for a small scale press is clear. This thesis introduces a simple design which achieves a yield of 46.9 mL per cup (U.S.) which matches the yield produced using industrial technologies. This corresponds to 153% increase in yield and 38.5% increase in rate over using traditional methods such as a mortar and pestle. The design consists of two fixed plates connected by four rods, with a third plate which slides along the four guide rods.",
      "(cont.) A standard scissor jack is the mechanism by which the necessary pressure of 800-1000 psi is generated to extract the oil. A peanut container with a removable bottom holds the peanuts as they are pressed, and holes drilled into its cylindrical face allow the oil to spill out into a collection dish underneath the container. The entire design is compact, with a footprint of one square foot and a height of 22 inches. This is 12 times smaller than the Beilenberg ram press, the standard for small scale presses currently used in developing countries. Experimental results of the loading profile as function of time show that the jack does not need to be turned continuously once the oil begins to appear. This requires significantly less strength than current methods of oil extraction. Although future work is recommended to further develop and improve the press, it shows promise of alleviating the need for such a device in many impoverished parts of the world."

      "The manual processing of food products has become a substantial part of the daily routine of a typical household in the developing world. Consumption of oil is an essential part of an individual's diet and thus, the production of oil is an essential activity. In many communities, this oil is obtained by manually pressing it from peanuts. In order to more efficiently and easily express oil from peanuts, a design for a treadle-powered peanut oil press was created. My thesis work will attempt to further increase the amount of oil extracted by optimizing the design of this peanut oil press. The press transfers the motion of the treadle to the horizontal motion of a piston that presses the peanuts via a rotating cam. The focus of this thesis will be optimizing the design of the cam with respect to oil yield. The shape of the cam determines the displacement profile of the piston's compression of the peanuts. I will determine the optimal profile by designing and performing experiments on a variety of different displacement profiles and measuring the amount of oil extracted from the pressed peanuts. The results of these experiments will then determine the optimal cam design."

      "One of the causes of malnutrition among the rural inhabitants of Sub-Saharan Africa is the high cost of dietary fats that are necessary to maintain normal body functions. Though the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN recommends an annual intake of 9.6 liters of dietary fats a year per person, some areas of Africa consume only about 1.5 liters annually. Many members of these communities lack the resources to purchase imported edible oils; locally produced peanut oil would provide a cheaper alternative. In addition, peanut production is particularly beneficial to farmers, as peanut plants enrich the soil they grow in. Once they have a steady supply of peanuts, the problem facing farmers is the inability to efficiently extract the oil from the nuts. The current design for human-powered rapid extraction is the Bielenberg ram press, which uses a lever to generate the required pressure needed to extract the oil. However, this design is not optimal for two reasons: it requires significant upper body strength to operate, and also, incorrect operation of the lever leads to only a fraction of the peanuts' oil content being extracted. For these reasons, this thesis focuses on a design modification originally proposed by a team in D-Lab Spring 2006.",
      "(cont.) While the oil extracting mechanism was kept intact, the lever was replaced by a cam-and-follower system driven by treadles. By moving the driving motion from the upper body to the lower body of the user, the new design aims to address the ergonomics issue present in the Bielenberg ram press. The cam also allows optimization of the pressure profile for the peanuts. Research performed by Ravi Patel in 2007 has shown that a rapid buildup followed by a long period of followed by a gradual advancing of the piston will create the desired pressure characteristics to maximize output. An earlier attempt to convert the Bielenberg ram press into a treadle design yielded several insights into how the design could be improved. These insights have led to many design modifications, which are incorporated into the proposed redesign. This redesign is aimed at improving performance, reducing cost, and increasing the manufacturability of the press."

      "Vaccines are very sensitive to temperature, needing to be held between 2 and 80°C to maintain potency. In developing countries where electricity and fuel supplies are unreliable, many vaccines are ruined due to thermal exposure. These are also the locations where vaccines are needed the most, yet often many of the vaccines given are ineffective. Long holdover vaccine coolers are designed to maintain a proper internal temperature during long periods of power loss. The most prevalent technology is the ice-lined cooler, but in the field these often have problem with freezing the vaccines. A vaccine cooler was designed that modifies the ice-jacket idea by separating the ice compartment and the vaccine chamber, connecting them through a heat transfer regulating device. The objective of this research is to design and prototype the heat transfer regulating device. After several design iterations a cooling loop filled with R-134a made of 1/8 piping, a 0.055 in ID capillary, and a Clippard normally-closed valve was combined with a modified car thermostat, using peanut oil as its working fluid, to create a thermosyphon type heat transfer device with a safety shutoff to prevent freezing. The prototype was manufactured and tested. It was found that with the proper amount of working fluid, it is possible to run the cooling loop at 4°C and pull heat from the vaccine chamber side to the ice. The peanut oil thermostat was tested and was found to open at a slightly lower temperature than expected, 2.5°C, but still within range. These results indicate that the concept is viable and should be tested in the vaccine cooler."

    "summary": [
      "Indoor air pollution is a serious health risk in developing countries, and is the leading cause of death for children under five. By replacing traditional cooking fuels with charcoal, one can significantly reduce a user's exposure to the particulate matter responsible for the detrimental health effects. The MIT D-Lab has have developed a method of creating charcoal using agriculture wastes such as bagasse and corncobs. However, it has been found that corncob charcoal produces dangerously high levels of carbon monoxide and as a result is unable to be burned directly and must be briquetted. In conjunction with this, an organization in Lima, Peru called Enlace Solidario makes coal briquettes in a configuration that optimizes the burning performance. They have entered in a partnership with the nearby orphanage of Segrada Familia to produce cooking fuel at no cost. However, Segrada Familia must supply their own ground charcoal to be briquetted. Thus, there is a clear need for a charcoal grinding machine. This thesis developed a successful grinding mechanism based on a peanut sheller design developed by the Full Belly Project. Though it needs to be scaled up to achieve the required throughput, this mechanism successfully limits the user's exposure to charcoal dust created during the grinding process and provides a means to produce corn cob powder necessary to briquette charcoal."

      "My Little Red Book is an anthology of stories about first periods, collected from women of all ages from around the world. The accounts range from lighthearted (the editor got hers while waterskiing in a yellow bathing suit) to heart-stopping (a first period discovered just as one girl was about to be strip-searched by the Nazis). The contributors include well-known women writers (Meg Cabot, Erica Jong, Gloria Steinem, Cecily von Ziegesar), alongside today's teens. Ultimately, My Little Red Book is more than a collection of stories. It is a call for a change in attitude. By revealing what it feels like to undergo this experience firsthand and giving women the chance to explain their feelings in their own words. My Little Red Book aims to provide support, entertainment, and a starting point for discussion for mothers and daughters everywhere."

      "\"Mathematical Programming Models for Agriculture, Environmental, and Resource Economics provides a comprehensive overview of mathematical programming models and their applications to real world and important problems confronting agricultural, environmental, and resource economists. Unlike most mathematical programming books, the principal focus of this text is on applications of these techniques and models to the fields of agricultural, environmental, and resource economics. The three fundamental goals of the book are to provide the reader with: (1) a level of background sufficient to apply mathematical programming techniques to real world policy and business to conduct solid research and analysis, (2) a variety of applications of mathematical programming to important problems in the areas of agricultural, environmental, and resource economics, and (3) a firm foundation for preparation to more advanced, Ph.D. level books on linear and/or nonlinear programming. Despite its introductory nature, the text places significant emphasis on real world applications of mathematical programming to decision problems. A wide array of examples and case studies are used to convey the various programming techniques available to decision analysts\"--"

      "This dissertation traces a transformation in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's governance of food markets during the second half of the 20th century. In response to new correlations between diet and risk of disease, anxieties about (over)abundant food supplies, and changing notions of personal versus collective responsibility in an affluent society, the FDA changed how it regulated food labeling. Following WWII, the agency developed a set of standard recipes with fixed common name labels (such as \"peanut butter\" or \"tomato soup\"), or \"standards of identity,\" for all mass-produced foods. However, the appearance of new diet foods and public health concerns undermined this system. Beginning in the 1970s, the FDA shifted its policies. Rather than rely on standardized identities, the agency required companies to provide informative labels such as the ingredients panel, nutrition labels, and various science-based health claims. Agency officials believed that such information would enable consumers to make responsible health decisions through market purchases. Food labeling is explored as a regulatory assemblage that draws together a variety of political, legal, corporate, and technoscientific interests and practices. The five chapters are organized chronologically. The first two describe how a shift in focus among nutrition scientists from concern for the undernourished to a concern with overeating led to the introduction onto the market of engineered foods capitalizing off popular interest in diet and health. A middle chapter describes a series of institutional scandals that generated the political animus to change the FDA's system, and registered a broader \"shock of recognition\" that Americans' views about food and food politics had changed. The final two chapters describe the introduction of \"Nutrition Information\" labeling in the 1970s and the mandatory \"Nutrition Facts\" panel in the 1990s. By looking at the regulation of labels as a kind of public-private infrastructure for information, the turn to compositional labeling can be understood not merely as a shift in representation-from whole foods to foods as nutrients-but more broadly as a retooling of food markets to embed notions about personal responsibility for health into the ways that food was designed, marketed, and consumed."

It examines Plath's creative processes: what she does with materials ranging from Romantic paintings to women's magazine fiction, how she transforms these in multiple drafts and the tools she uses to do this, including her use of colour. Finally the book investigates specific instances when Plath herself becomes the subject matter for other artists, writers, film makers and biographers\"--"

      "Life in a rural village in Mauritania is hard on women. Tradition and Islamic religion are intertwined to reinforce strict gender roles. The husband is the protector and keeper; his word is law. While the men take their ease, the girls and women are off to the fields during the peanut planting and harvest season, walking five miles each way, and coming home with heavy burdens from the fields to prepare the family dinner. They carry the water, sweep the yard, wash the clothes, and care for the children. This short, beautifully filmed video captures succinctly the subservience of women, while at the same time remaining respectful of tradition and culture. There are no drugs, alcohol or loneliness in this kind of community, where family bonds are very strong. We hear from several young Peace Corps workers in the village who are hopeful that by educating and thereby widening the horizons of young women, eventually women will have more choices. From a Western perspective, the future of Africa depends on education and family planning."

      "Soil and water management is the key to sustainable crop production and food security. This publication contains contributions from participants of an IAEA coordinated research program on the use of nuclear techniques for developing integrated nutrient and water management practices for agroforestry systems. A representative range of agroforestry systems (tree fallows, alley crops, agro-silvo-pastoral systems, shade trees and windbreaks) were studied under variable soil and climatic conditions. The studies were primarily concerned with the central issue in agroforestry, namely, whether trees and crops are competitive or complementary in their use of natural resources, principally water and nutrients. Nuclear and isotopic techniques were used to provide crucial information on nutrient and water dynamics in agroforestry systems. The studies show that the integration of trees and crops can increase resource use efficiency, but careful management and a system design tailored to local climatic and soil conditions are required if competition and consequent reduction in crop yields are to be avoided--Publisher's description."

    "summary": [
      "Carver had a truly prolific career dedicated to studying the ways in which people ought to interact with the natural world, yet much of his work has been largely forgotten. Hersey rectifies this by tracing the evolution of Carver's agricultural and environmental thought starting with his childhood in Missouri and Kansas and his education at the Iowa Agricultural College. Carver's environmental vision came into focus when he moved to the Tuskegee Institute in Macon County, Alabama, where his sensibilities and training collided with the denuded agrosystems, deep poverty, and institutional racism of the Black Belt.-publisher description."

      "\"Preface to the Fifth Edition The golden era of food microbiology has begun. All three areas of food microbiology, beneficial, spoilage, and pathogenic microbiology, are expanding and progressing at an incredible pace; thus, it is difficult for one to stay abreast of new developments. A genuine attempt has been made to capture those developments in this new edition. Spoilage-causing microorganisms are a major concern. To feed the growing population in the world, microbial food spoilage must be reduced, and improved intervention technologies must be developed. To achieve that goal, it is necessary to understand the problems; that would help to develop effective control methods for different types of foods, especially using the hurdle concept. In the past decade, foodborne pathogens have broadened their association with varieties of foods that were unexpected, such as Salmonella in peanut butter, fish, and spices; Listeria monocytogenes in cantaloupe and celery; and a new strain of Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (O104:H4) with sprouts. To have a greater understanding of pathogen association in preharvest plants and meat animals, the concerted efforts of plant biologists, animal scientists, soil chemists, environmental scientists, agriculture and biological engineers, social scientists, and microbiologists are needed to address food safety and quality issues\"--Provided by publisher."

      "In 1993, late architect Samuel Mockbee founded Auburn University's Rural Studio, an education program in which architecture students leave the university setting to live and work in rural Hale County, Alabama. In one of the poorest parts of America, a community in which 1 in 4 citizens live in poverty, students use donated and recycled materials to build homes and community facilities. The film presents the story of students' experiences during a typical year in one of the most prolific and inspirational design-build outreach programs ever established, including historical interviews with Mockbee. Infusing the film with a larger discussion of architecture's role in addressing issues of poverty, class, race, education, social change, and citizenship are other architects and designers who share praise and criticism of the Rural Studio."

Their unique ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen in association with Rhizobia enriches soil fertility, and establishes the importance of their niche in agriculture. Divided into two volumes, this work presents an up-to-date analysis of in vitro and recombinant DNA technologies for the improvement of grain, forage and tree legumes. Volume 10B presents the current state and future prospects of in vitro regeneration and genetic transformation expression and stability of transgenes modification of traits in almost all the important legumes, for example: soybean; peanut; pea; french bean; chick pea; pigeon pea; cowpea; mung bean; black gram; azuki bean; lentil; Lathyrus; lupinus; Lotus spp; Medicago spp; Trifolium spp; Winged bean; Guar; and tree legumes for their improvement."

      "Discusses how the progressive principles of a born-again Evangelical Christian peanut farmer, which included racial justice, women's rights, and concern for the plight of the poor, won the presidency in 1976.",
      "\"Evangelical Christianity and conservative politics are today seen as inseparable. But when Jimmy Carter, a Democrat and a born-again Christian, won the presidency in 1976, he owed his victory in part to American evangelicals, who responded to his open religiosity and his rejection of the moral bankruptcy of the Nixon Administration. Carter, running as a representative of the New South, articulated a progressive strand of American Christianity that championed liberal ideals, racial equality, and social justice--one that has almost been forgotten since. In Redeemer, acclaimed religious historian Randall Balmer reveals how the rise and fall of Jimmy Carter's political fortunes mirrored the transformation of American religious politics. From his beginnings as a humble peanut farmer to the galvanizing politician who rode a reenergized religious movement into the White House, Carter's life and career mark him as the last great figure in America's long and venerable history of progressive evangelicalism. Although he stumbled early in his career--courting segregationists during his second campaign for Georgia governor--Carter's run for president marked a return to the progressive principles of his faith and helped reenergize the evangelical movement. Responding to his message of racial justice, women's rights, and concern for the plight of the poor, evangelicals across the country helped propel Carter to office. Yet four years later, those very same voters abandoned him for Ronald Reagan and the Republican Party. Carter's defeat signaled the eclipse of progressive evangelicalism and the rise of the Religious Right, which popularized a dramatically different understanding of the faith, one rooted in nationalism, individualism, and free-market capitalism. An illuminating biography of our 39th president, Redeemer presents Jimmy Carter as the last great standard-bearer of an important strand of American Christianity, and provides an original and riveting account of the moments that transformed our political landscape in the 1970s and 1980s\"--Provided by publisher."

      "This book consists of invited reviews on Galactic Bulges written by experts in the field. A central point of the book is that, while in the standard picture of galaxy formation a significant amount of the baryonic mass is expected to reside in classical bulges, the question what is the fraction of galaxies with no classical bulges in the local Universe has remained open. The most spectacular example of a galaxy with no significant classical bulge is the Milky Way. The reviews of this book attempt to clarify the role of the various types of bulges during the mass build-up of galaxies, based on morphology, kinematics, and stellar populations, and connecting their properties at low and high redshifts. The observed properties are compared with the predictions of the theoretical models, accounting for the many physical processes leading to the central mass concentration and their destruction in galaxies. This book serves as an entry point for PhD students and non-specialists and as a reference work for researchers in the field."

      "How to achieve sustainable agricultural production without compromising environmental quality, agro-ecosystem function and biodiversity is a serious consideration in current agricultural practices. Farming systems' growing dependency on chemical inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, nutrients etc.) poses serious threats with regard tocrop productivity, soil fertility, the nutritional value of farm produce, management of pests and diseases, agro-ecosystem well-being, and health issues for humans and animals. At the same time, microbial inoculants in the form of biofertilizers, plant growth promoters, biopesticides, soil health managers, etc. have gained considerable attention among researchers, agriculturists, farmers and policy makers. The first volume of the book Microbial Inoculants in Sustainable Agricultural Productivity - Research Perspectives highlights the efforts of global experts with regard to various aspects of microbial inoculants. Emphasis is placed on recent advances in microbiological techniques for the isolation, characterization, identification and evaluation of functional properties using biochemical and molecular tools. The taxonomic characterization of agriculturally important microorganisms is documented, along with their applications in field conditions. The book exploresthe identification, characterization and diversity analysis of endophytic microorganisms in various crops including legumes/ non-legumes, as well as the assessment of their beneficial impacts in the context of promotingplant growth. Moreover, it provides essential updates onthe diversity and role of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and arbuscular mycorrhizal mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Further chaptersexamine in detailbiopesticides, thehigh-density cultivation of bioinoculants in submerged culture, seed biopriming strategies for abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, andPGPR as abio-control agent. Given its content,the book offers a valuable resource for researchers involved in research and development concerningPGPR, biopesticides and microbial inoculants."

      "\"The Reverend Howard Finster (1916-2001) was called the 'backwoods William Blake' and the 'Andy Warhol of the South, ' and he is considered the godfather of contemporary American folk and visionary art. This book is the first interpretive analysis of the intertwined artistic and religious significance of Finster's work within the context of the American 'outsider art' tradition. Finster began preaching as a teenager in the South in the 1930s. But it was not until he received a revelation from God at the age of 60 that he began to make sacred art. A modern-day Noah who saw his art as a religious crusade to save the world before it was too late, Finster worked around the clock, often subsisting on a diet of peanut butter and instant coffee. He spent the last years of his life feverishly creating his environmental artwork called Paradise Garden and what would ultimately number almost 50,000 works of 'bad and nasty art.' This was visionary work that obsessively combined images and text and featured apocalyptic biblical imagery, flying saucers from outer space, and popular cultural icons such as Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, Henry Ford, Mona Lisa, and George Washington. In the 1980s and 90s, he developed cult celebrity status, and he appeared in the Venice Biennale and on the Tonight Show. His work graced the album covers of bands such as R.E.M. and Talking Heads. This book explores the life and religious-artistic significance of Finster and his work from the personal perspective of religion scholar Norman Girardot, friend to Finster and his family during the later years of the artist's life\"--Provided by publisher."

      "Belle Boggs recounts her realization that she might never be able to conceive. She searches the apparently fertile world around her -- the emergence of thirteen-year cicadas, the birth of eaglets near her rural home, and an unusual gorilla pregnancy at a local zoo -- for signs that she is not alone. Boggs also explores other aspects of fertility and infertility: the way longing for a child plays out in the classic Coen brothers film \"Raising Arizona\"; the depiction of childlessness in literature, from \"Macbeth\" to \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\"; the financial and legal complications that accompany alternative means of family making; the private and public expressions of iconic writers grappling with motherhood and fertility. She reports complex stories of couples who adopted domestically and from overseas, LGBT couples considering assisted reproduction and surrogacy, and women and men reflecting on childless or child-free lives."

      "\"Mobilizing Metaphor illustrates how artistic and radical efforts are reshaping disability activism in Canada and, in the process, challenging dominant perceptions of disability. Recent changes to Canadian disability policy have seen disability programs hampered by funding cuts and other austerity measures. But this oppression has also given new life to an already vibrant Canadian tradition of disability activism. Until now, research has focused on the legal and policy spheres and overlooked disability activism that expresses itself alongside and outside conventional policy reform, often through a variety of art forms. Here, contributions by disability artists, activists, and academics show how disability art is distinctive as both art and social action. Richly illustrated with photographs and other images, and including an insightful concluding chapter by renowned disability scholar Tanya Titchkoksy, this array of artistic, cultural, and radical approaches to disability politics demonstrates that disability activism is as varied as the populations it represents. As the contributors sketch the shifting contours of disability politics in Canada and show how disability oppression is not isolated from other prejudices, they challenge us to re-examine how we enact social and political change\"--"

      "Called 'disgraceful,' 'third-rate,' and 'not nice' by Donald Trump, NBC News correspondent Katy Tur reported on -- and took flak from -- the most volatile presidential candidate in American history. Katy Tur lived out of a suitcase for a year and a half, following Trump around the country, powered by packets of peanut butter and kept clean with dry shampoo. She visited forty states with the candidate, made more than 3,800 live television reports, and tried to endure a gazillion loops of Elton John's 'Tiny Dancer' -- a Trump rally playlist staple. From day 1 to day 500, Tur documented Trump's inconsistencies, fact-checked his falsities, and called him out on his lies. In return, Trump repeatedly singled Tur out. He tried to charm her, intimidate her, and shame her. At one point, he got a crowd so riled up against Tur, Secret Service agents had to walk her to her car. Through all the long nights, wild scoops, naked chauvinism, dodgy staffers, and fevered debates, no one had a better view than Tur. This is her darkly comic and often scary story of how America sent a former reality show host to the White House. It's also the story of what it was like for Tur to be there as it happened, inside a no-rules world where reporters were spat on, demeaned, and discredited. Tur was a foreign correspondent who came home to her most foreign story of all. Unbelievable is for anyone who still wakes up and wonders, Is this real life?"

    "summary": [
      "The book is a compilation of research work carried out on plant viruses during past 100 years in India. Plant viruses are important constraints in Indian agriculture. Tropical and sub-tropical environments and intensive crop cultivation practices ideally favours perpetuation of numerous plant viruses and their vectors in India, which often cause wide spread crop losses. Of all the plant pathogens, studies of plant viruses have received a special attention as they are difficult to manage. A large body of literature has been published on the plant virus research from India during past 100 years; however the information is so far not available in one place. This book provides comprehensive information on the biology, molecular biology, epidemics, crop losses, diagnosis and management of viruses and viroids occurring in India. Description of properties of the viruses are provided in the chapters comprising of different genera such as Allexivirus, Begomovirus, Babuvirus, Badnavirus, Carlavirus, Carmovirus, Cucumovirus, Closterovirus, Ilavirus, Mandrivirus, Potyvirus, Tospovirus, Tungrovirus and Sobemovirus. Virus-vector research related to aphid, thrips and whitefly is discussed. The work on the management aspects of plant viral diseases has been described with reference to the conventional, antiviral and transgenic approaches. Further, the quarantine mechanism developed in India for the exclusion of viruses and vectors has also been included. The book also provides useful information about the capacity building on the research and education on Plant Virology in India. Overall, the book covers a wide range of accounts of research findings and innovations in Plant Virology in India during past 100 years. The book will be a resourceful reference to the students, scientists, agricultural professionals and policy makers."

      "A former \"New Yorker\" editor chronicles her quest to overcome the convergence of the sudden loss of her brother, being dumped by her fiancé, and being evicted from her apartment by cooking her way across the country while staying with friends and family.",
      "\"There's no real logic to where we start out and what we end up with. It's like cooking. Once you get your ingredients, how you put them together at any given time is up to you: it's your responsibility to create something good. ... It helps to have a high tolerance for disasters, in the kitchen or otherwise. One life-changing night, reeling from her beloved brother's sudden death, a devastating breakup with her handsome engineer fiancé, and eviction from the apartment they shared, Emily Nunn had lost all sense of family, home, and financial security. After a few glasses of wine, heartbroken and unmoored, Emily--an avid cook and professional food writer--decided to pour her heart out on Facebook. The next morning, she woke up with an awful hangover and a feeling she'd made a terrible mistake--only to discover she had more friends than she knew, many of whom invited her to come visit and cook with them as she put her life back together. Thus began the Comfort Food Tour. Searching for a way forward, Emily travels the country, cooking and staying with family and friends. She also travels back home to revisit scenes from her dysfunctional Southern upbringing, dominated by her dramatic, unpredictable mother and her silent, disengaged father. Her wonderfully idiosyncratic relatives come alive in these pages, all part of the rich Southern story in which past and present are indistinguishable, food is a source of connection and identity, and a good story is often preferred to a not-so-pleasant truth. But truth, pleasant or not, is what Emily Nunn craves, and with it comes an acceptance of the losses she has endured, and a sense of hope for the future. In the salty snap of a single Virginia ham biscuit and the sour tang of Great-grandmother's Mean Lemon Cake, she experiences the healing power of comfort food--and serves up dozens of recipes for the wonderful dishes that saved her life. With biting humor and luminous prose, Emily Nunn delivers a moving account of her descent into darkness and her hard-won return to the living.\"--Jacket.",

      "\"This book presents the current state of the art in peanut genomics, focusing particularly on the latest genomic findings, tools and strategies employed in genome sequencing, transcriptomes and analysis, availability of public and private genomic resources, and ways to maximize the use of this information in peanut breeding programs. Further, it demonstrates how advances in plant genomics can be used to improve crop breeding. The peanut or groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L. Millsp) is a globally important grain legume and oilseed crop, cultivated in over 100 countries and consumed in the form of roasted seeds, oil and confectionary in nearly every country on Earth. The peanut contributes towards achieving food and nutritional security, in addition to financial security through income generation; as such, it is also vital to the livelihood of the poor in the developing world. There have been significant advances in peanut research, especially in the last five years, including sequencing the genome of both diploid progenitors, and the availability of tremendous transcriptome resources, large-scale genomic variations that can be used as genetic markers, genetic populations (bi- and multiparent populations and germplasm sets), marker-trait associations and molecular breeding products. The immediate availability of the genome sequence for tetraploid cultivated peanuts is the most essential genomic resource for achieving a deeper understanding of peanut traits and their use in breeding programs.\"--"

      "This book systematically covers the sensory, physical, chemical nutrition, and processing characteristics of different peanut varieties, while also providing an in-depth review of research advances in peanut processing quality. The book goes on to examine the relationship between raw materials and the qualities of peanut protein, peanut oil and other main peanut processing products. As such, it provides a valuable reference guide for research into the raw materials, change mechanisms and control technologies used in peanut processing, laying the groundwork for the development of new disciplines in “grain and oil processing quality”. It will be useful for graduate students, researchers, and management groups from multidisciplinary audiences, covering both food science & technology and public health."

    "summary": [
      "\"Manipulation of the water content of foods is a classical method for food preservation and has been used by people for centuries. Salting, curing, drying, and the addition of sugars are examples of several traditional preservation methods. Of particular interest are the low moisture foods and food ingredients that are naturally low in moisture or that have been subjected to a drying process. Processed products such as milk powders, chocolate, peanut butter, infant foods, cereal and bakery products are the examples of this type of food. Low moisture foods have received significant attention in recent years due to a number of food safety related events (e.g. peanut butter products). Many pathogens, such as Salmonella, due to its enhanced thermal residence in dry environments, are able to survive drying processes and may persist for a long time in low moisture foods, especially when stored at refrigerated temperatures. While these food products do not support the growth of Salmonella and other bacterial pathogens, many have been linked to the recent nationwide outbreaks/recalls (e.g. nuts, cereal products, and spices). This has raised awareness of low moisture foods as a vector for food foodborne illness. Salmonella and other bacterial pathogen contamination of low moisture foods has become an emerging and vexing food safety challenge for low moisture foods. Food processors should be well advised to enact highly disciplined safety control measures to address the risk of Salmonella and other pathogenic bacteria in low moisture foods. A number of peer reviewed journal articles have explored the characteristics and food safety concerns associated with low moisture foods. However there are no books currently available which define prevalence and persistence of such pathogens and offer solution techniques for manufacturers who produce low moisture products. This book will aim to define sources and risk factors for pathogenic bacteria of concern in the manufacturing environment for low moisture/water activity products and characterize the persistence and thermal resistance of these pathogens in both the environment and the food product. A variety of foods will be discussed and multiple processing platforms evaluated from the standpoint of process validation to reach the appropriate Food Safety Objective (FSO) for the finished/packaged product prior to consumption. The book will define appropriate industry practices for the control and elimination of pathogens in these products and will provide information on current guidelines and product specific organizations that have developed such guidance and protocols (e.g. Almond Board of CA). Current Regulatory requirements will be discussed and any recommendations given will be science based on and in accordance with current rules. We will also provide a comprehensive modelling chapter to describe various aspects of pathogen detection and management. Life cycle models which describe the farm-to-fork prevalence of pathogens in low moisture foods will be combined with primary modelling concepts for growth, death and survival in both the environment and the products. Microbiological testing methods for inoculation, recovery and selection will be discussed in detail. The final chapter will explore spoilage organisms associated with these products (including yeasts and molds)\"--"

      "This book guides students through cases and exercises that explore crisis communication and management in action and build the necessary skills for effective crisis management. In the first two chapters, the author W. Timothy Coombs introduces key theories and principles in crisis communication, which the students apply through analysis of 17 cases drawn from recent headlines. The cases are explored from pre-crisis, mid-crisis, and post-crisis perspectives, and include a range of predominant crisis scenarios from product recalls to lawsuits to environmental disasters. Exercises are included to help students apply concepts from crisis communication and management such as crisis threat assessment and the utility of social media in scanning for crisis warning signs. The appendix includes sample crisis management plans, sample crisis response strategy templates, and ..."

      "Playback is the first book to place the fascinating history of sound reproduction within its larger social, economic, and cultural context-and includes appearances by everyone from Thomas Edison to Enrico Caruso to Dick Clark to Grandmaster Flash to Napster CEO Shawn Fanning. In a narrative that begins with Edison's cylinder and ends with digital music, the ubiquitous iPod, and the file-sharing wars, this is a history we have all experienced in one way or another. From the Victrola, the 78, the 45, and the 33 1/3 to the 8-track, cassette, compact disc, DAT, and MP3, the story of Playback is also the story of music, and the music business in the twentieth century and beyond.--Publisher description."

    "summary": [
      "Iron is a major constituent of the earth crust. However, under alkaline conditions commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments iron becomes unavailable to plants. When plants are affected by a shortage of iron their leaves become yellow (chlorotic), and both plant growth and crop yield are reduced. The roots of plants affected by iron deficiency may develop a series of responses directed to improve iron uptake, such as increased proton excretion and iron reduction capabilities or excretion of iron chela tors called siderophores. Iron deficiency affects major crops worldwide, including some of major economic importance such as fruit trees and others. Correction of iron deficiency is usually implemented through costly application of synthetic chelates. Since these correction methods are very expensive, the competitivity of farmers is often reduced and iron deficiency may become a limiting factor for the maintenance, introduction or expansion of some crops. In spite of the many years devoted to the study of iron deficiency, the knowledge of iron deficiency in soils and plants is still fragmentary in many aspects. We have only incomplete information on the processes at the molecular level that make some plant species and cultivars unable to take and utilize iron from the soil, whereas other plants grow satisfactorily under the same conditions."

      "While working in the laboratory of Professor Dr. Jacob Reinert at the Freie Universitat Berlin (1974-1976), I had the opportunity to become deeply involved in studying the intricacies of the fascinating phenomenon of somatic embryogenesis in plant cells and protoplasts. In numerous stimu\u00ad lating discussions with Professor Reinert on this subject, I was fully convinced that somatic embryogenesis would become one of the most important areas of study, not only regarding basic and fundamental aspects, but also for its application in crop improvement. During the last decade, we have witnessed tremendous interest and achievements in the use of somatic embryos for the production of synthetic seeds, for micro prop a\u00ad gation, genetic transformation, cryopreservation, and conservation of germplasm. The en masse production of somatic embryos in the bioreactors has facilitated some of these studies. Somatic embryos have now been induced in more than 300 plant species belonging to a wide range offamilies. It was therefore felt that a compilation ofliterature/state of the art on this subject was necessary. Thus, two volumes on Somatic Embryo\u00ad genesis and Synthetic Seed have been compiled, which contain 65 chapters contributed by International experts. Somatic Embryogenesis and Synthetic Seed I comprises 31 chapters, arranged in 3 sections: Section I Commitment of the cell to somatic embryogenesis; early events; anatomy; molecular basis; gene expression; role of polyamines; machine vision analysis of somatic embryos. Section II Applications of somatic embryos; technology of synthetic seed; fluid drilling; micropropagation; genetic transfor\u00ad mation through somatic embryos; cryopreservation."

      "In a Trance is just the sort of genre-defying work we at Peanut and punctum and, as it happens, Jeffrey Skoblow, revel in. It is a book-length essay by a fiction writer. It is a fictional essay by a literary scholar. It is a gallant assay by a smart man who thinks while he walks, and he walks a lot.The book is a meta-meditation on Paleolithic cave drawings and the humans who ponder them. It is fact-based and entrancing just as the cave drawings are actual (existing in time -- loosely -- and space -- more definitively) and mesmerizing. Skoblow is devising stories as \"we\" (humans) have always devised stories though in a less familiar mode, along a less travelled path.The essay draws on (!) the careful/thoughtful/whimsical notebooks kept by Skoblow over a dozen years. The notebooks record/illuminate/complicate his visits to twelve Paleolithic art sites as well as his deep, eccentric reading of texts concerned in some way with the subject of cave drawings by an array of scientists, anthropologists, archeologists, art historians, and other sundry enthusiasts and experts, so-called and otherwise.I saw the caves and didn't know what to do with them. So I started writing in Spring '01 to try to figure it out. The first words I wrote were \"The caves themselves.\" A few pages later: \"The caves, no doubt, blah blah blah. To find a way to talk about them: impossible.\" It wasn't going well.These are one man's marks made about making marks. Skoblow's meticulous descriptions attempt the impossible: to provide the \"information\" that will allow us to see what is visible, invisible, restricted, unseen, hidden, and lost (in the sense of not yet found, or destroyed, or degraded by human presence) beneath the ground at El Castillo and Niaux (for instance). Lines, dots, dashes, body parts, animals, and \"hum-animal\" figures -- things/creatures we have given name to (bison? rhino? vulva? phallus?) in our helplessly homo-sapien-centric attempts to understand (and/or to master our non-understanding).The Great Being would appear to be an androgynous figure, or rather, an ungendered figure almost mistakable for a skull, all the matter of a few deft lines: a slightly crumpled egg-shaped braincase with no representation of hair or other individualizing features, an overlarge eye and a blunt nose, a mouth curving in a long slow grin, maybe, of stupefaction or benediction, benign and spooky all at once.Here is a leaping mind.We follow Skoblow as he steps onto an electric train in the caves at Rouffignac and steps out in Southern Illinois, where he cautiously crosses a snake-ridden (maybe) meadow. This is where he meanders further -- literally and figuratively: further from the actual caves, furtherest from certainty. These furtherings are exactly what we might expect from a book that from its opening pages declares as one if its themes the difficulties inherent in considering Paleolithic art.It is problematic ... for reasons having to do with the nature of representation and, no doubt, the mysteries of sentient experience. There is also the problem of expectations and intent: to whom does one speak about the caves, and for what purpose?The pleasures of this book are found in Skoblow's intense, vigilant exploration of these problems and questions, which are in themselves irresistible. Who are we? In what ways, specifically, and to what degree do we resemble these ancient humans who spray- and brush-painted, smudged, carved, and stenciled images into and onto cave walls and floors and ceilings?Signs emptied of meaning, a kind of dream, a salve and a reassurance, possibly terrifying, too. A plunge into signs."

      "Jimmy Carter: He grew up in the tiny hamlet of Plains, Georgia, the son of a well-off peanut farmer and married sweetheart Rosalynn Smith in 1946 after graduating from the Naval Academy. After seven years in the Navy, where he trained in nuclear physics, Carter returned home to work on the family farm following his father's death. Vivien Leigh: Her first Oscar was for an even more iconic role – one of the most lauded and hyped in Hollywood history – Scarlett O'Hara in 1939's Gone With The Wind. She won the part after a highly publicized casting process by producer David O Selznick, during which practically every A-List actress in Hollywood auditioned.  Jack Dempsey: In 1916, writer Damon Runyan dubbed boxer Jack Dempsey the 'Manassa Mauler'. Dempsey's aggressive style and match-winning knock out blows made him one of America's most idolized fighters. In his 78-bout career, he delivered 49 knockouts, 25 of them in the first round. Anne Frank: On the 12th of June 1942, a thirteen year-old Jewish girl called Annelies Frank wrote the first entry in what was to become the most famous diary in the world. Born in Frankfurt, Germany, Anne and her family fled the Nazis in 1933 and settled in Amsterdam. But their situation became perilous again in 1940 when the Nazis occupied Holland and started rounding up the Jews. Princess Diana, Part 1: Although the history of the British monarchy is full of executions, abdications and other scandals, its notable stability during the five decades that Elizabeth the Second has been on the throne lulled the great British public into a false sense of peace and consistency. All that changed with the advent of Diana Spencer."

The program was organized by members of the Program and Planning Committee. They invited leading scientists in specific topic areas and accepted contributed papers from individuals and laboratories actively involved in relevant areas of research and study. The participation of established scientists was encouraged. The Society (PABS) undertook to ensure that the program reflected current developments, informed reviews, embryonic and developing areas, and critical assessment for several aspects of the present state of knowledge as it relates to the major sections of the proceedings. Obviously, not all aspects of biodeterioration or biodegradation are represented."

      "Saponins are glycosides of triterpenes, steroids or steroidal alkaloids. They can be found in plants and marine organisms. Very diverse biological activities are ascribed to saponins and they play important roles in food, animal feedstuffs, and pharmaceutical properties. This volume provides a selection of recent work on saponins presented at a symposium in Pulawy, Poland, in 1999. Many different aspects are treated: analysis, separation, biological activities, relevant use in human and animal nutrition, and ecological significance. This book will be of use to researchers both in universities and industry."

      "\"Experience classic and modern Mexican street foods with chef Roberto Santibañez. Mexico's simplest, flavor-packed foods have taken the culinary world by storm. From upscale eateries to the burgeoning roving food truck scenes in Los Angeles, New York, and elsewhere, authentic Mexican tacos--and tortas and tamales as well--are fast becoming some of America's favorite foods on the fly. And why wouldn't they? Versatile, handheld, and uncomplicated, tacos might be the perfect fast and delicious meal. Add the simple Mexican sandwiches called tortas and handmade tamales and you can fully experience the real everyday food of Mexico--easy to make and incredibly tasty. But if an authentic, south-of-the-border taco is out of reach, you can now recreate your own at home. One of the best things about real Mexican home cooking is that it's easier than you think. With simple preparations, delicious ingredients, and basic rules of thumb, you can make your favorites in the comfort of your own kitchen. People from coast to coast are ditching fast food tacos and greasy Tex-Mex for real Mexican food at home--and this is the perfect cookbook for them Roberto Santiba&ntilde;ez is the author of two other cookbooks, including Truly Mexican (Wiley), the owner of Fonda restaurant in Brooklyn, the former culinary director of Rosa Mexicano restaurants, the president of Truly Mexican Consulting in New York, and a member of The Culinary Institute of America's Latin Cuisines Advisory Council In addition to tacos, tortas, and tamales, the book also includes recipes for fresh juices, smoothies, margaritas, and traditional Mexican sweets Chef Santibañez's Tacos, Tortas, and Tamales will give you the simple guidance and authentic recipes to bring the true flavors of Mexico into your own kitchen\"--"

      "The double helix architecture of DNA was elucidated in 1953. Twenty years later, in 1973, the discovery of restriction enzymes helped to create recombinant DNA molecules in vitro. The implications of these powerful and novel methods of molecular biology, and their potential in the genetic manipulation and improvement of microbes, plants and animals, became increasingly evident, and led to the birth of modern biotechnology. The first transgenic plants in which a bacterial gene had been stably integrated were produced in 1983, and by 1993 transgenic plants had been produced in all major crop species, including the cereals and the legumes. These remarkable achievements have resulted in the production of crops that are resistant to potent but environmentally safe herbicides, or to viral pathogens and insect pests. In other instances genes have been introduced that delay fruit ripening, or increase starch content, or cause male sterility. Most of these manipulations are based on the introduction of a single gene - generally of bacterial origin - that regulates an important monogenic trait, into the crop of choice. Many of the engineered crops are now under field trials and are expected to be commercially produced within the next few years. The early successes in plant biotechnology led to the realization that further molecular improvement of plants will require a thorough understanding of the molecular basis of plant development, and the identification and character\u00ad ization of genes that regulate agronomically important multi genic traits."

      "In the early summer of '89 a very informal meeting on the bulge of our Galaxy was held in Leiden. During that meeting Michael Rich proposed to hold a more properly organised symposium on \"Galactic Bulges\" in a few years time. After some discussion a Scientific Organising Committee was founded and after some manoeuvring a chairman was chosen, a local organiser was assigned and two editors were given instructions. A good thing about the location of the meeting was that Ghent is a very beautiful city and had never before hosted an IAU symposium. It could be that this, plus the fact that he is a very keen amateur astronomer led H. M. the King of Belgium to offer his patronage to the meeting - an offer that we gratefully and - we hope - gracefully accepted. The meeting took place at a resort some 15 km outside Ghent. Most participants were housed on the premises - a very convenient situation. This feeling of togeth\u00ad erness made up for the small shortcomings of the lecture room, which is normally used as a sports hall. The weather was fair, except on the day of the barbecue when pouring rain forced us to go inside."

      "Along with the traditional optical window, many new windows have been opened on galaxies in the last two decades, made possible by new developments in groundbased detectors and by space missions that allow detection of photons that are otherwise absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. Galaxies can now be observed in the radio, submillimeter, IR, optical, UV, X- and gamma-ray bands, each window allowing us to learn more about galactic components and properties. These developments have also imposed the view that a deeper understanding of even normal galaxies requires a panchromatic approach, making use of all of the data gathered from the different windows to synthesize a comprehensive physical image of these complex astronomical systems. Windows on Galaxies presents a comprehensive view of galaxies through all the available windows, bringing together both theoretical and experimental approaches in the form of a series of reviews reporting the most recent developments complemented by contributed talks and discussions. TEXT NO. 2 The sixth workshop of the Advanced School of Astronomy examined galaxies through all available wavelength windows. Over the last twenty years, new wavelength windows have been opened in astronomy which have created many new possibilities for the observation of the properties of galaxies. The outcome of the meeting clearly stated that the approach towards the studying of galaxies should be panchromatic. Each window, from radio to gamma-rays, shows different components, and a synthesis of this knowledge presents astronomers with a comprehensive physical image of these astronomical systems: star formation, evolution of galaxies, molecular contents, gas flows, interstellar matter and properties of galaxies in the several wavelength fields are discussed in this volume."

      "Islam has influenced West Africa since the 11th century, but only in the last 100 years has the religion grown so rapidly in Senegal and Mali. One prominent sect, the Murid movement which grew out of Sufism, has millions of followers and wealth accumulated from peanut cultivation. As a force of conservative Islam, its economic and political power must be watched by the West."

    "summary": [
      "This book provides researchers the opportunity to investigate type-2-associated diseases in their laboratories. Beginning with chapters describing various models of type-2 immunity, the volume then continues by detailing cellular protocols designed to identify, characterize, and assess the function of key adaptive and innate immune cells involved in type-2 inflammation; approaches to isolate and evaluate specific cellular subsets at the genetic, epigenetic, and molecular level; protocols to assess type-2 immunity and its relationship to organismal and metabolic systems (ex. Microbiome). This book concludes with a section that explores the use of primary human cells in evaluating relevance to the clinic. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Vital and authoritative, Type 2 Immunity: Methods and Protocols aims to provide a broad network of methods that can be used to develop a hypothesis and investigate its potential from bench to beside. ."

      "This publication reports the proceedings of a one-day seminar on The AppZicatian af Mathematics in Industry held at the Australian National University on Wednesday, December 3, 1980. It was organized jointly by the Division of Mathematics and Statistics, CSIRO, and the Departments of Pure and Applied Mathematics, The Faculty of Science, Australian National University. A paper based on the talk \"Some uses of statistically designed experiments in industrial problems\" given by N.B. Carter at the Seminar was not received by the editors. Though R.M. Lewis of John Lysaght (Australia) Limited did not present a talk, the editors invited him to submit a paper. They only learnt about his work after the program for the seminar had been finalized and publicized. His paper appears as the last paper in these proceedings and is entitled \"A simple model for coil interior temperature prediction during batch annealing\". The seminar was opened by Dr J.R. Philip, FAA, FRS, Director of the Physical Sciences Institute, CSIRO. He kindly agreed to supply an edited version of his comments for inclusion in the proceedings. They follow the Foreword as Opening Remarks."

      "Micropropagation is a reliable technology applied commercially worldwide for large-scale plant multiplication, germplasm conservation, pathogen elimination, genetic manipulations and supply of selected plants. In Protocols for Micropropagation of Selected Economically-Important Horticultural Plants, well recognised researchers in the field compile step-wise protocols for rapid plant multiplication of economically-important horticultural species. The book contains 35 chapters, divided into four major sections. The first three sections (Section A, B and C) contain 29 micropropagation protocols of selected fruit and nut species, indoor and outdoor ornamental plants, cut flowers, and vegetables. In addition to the detailed protocols of in vitro shoot initiation, proliferation, root induction and acclimatization, chapters also include detailed information on medium preparation, explant selection and preparation. The six chapters of Section D cover specific reviews on pivotal topics, such as in vitro rejuvenation, synthetic seed technology, thermotherapy and meristem culture in banana, genetic transformation of pineapple, flower color somaclonal variation in torenia, and cryotherapy of horticultural crops. Moreover, as a part of the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series, chapters include introductions to the respective topic, lists of necessary materials, notes, and illustrative photos. Comprehensive and well-written, Protocols for Micropropagation of Selected Economically-Important Horticultural Plants offers a useful resource for horticulturists, researchers, commercial companies, plant propagators, biotechnologists and students interested in micropropagation."

    "summary": [
      "Acceptance or rejection of any edible commodity, whether it is raw or processed, is usually conditioned by sensory stimuli. The impact of these stimuli on the decision-making proce·ss is broadly termed sensory evaluation. Advances in sensory evaluation research have been slow in the past because of the human factor-the necessity to use highly trained sensory panels to conduct this research. High technology in\u00ad strumentation and new understandings of sensory evaluations are now combining to make possible quantum jumps forward in sensory eval\u00ad uation research. It is widely recognized that the sensory aspects of fruits and vegeta\u00ad bles are affected by many factors, among them environment, variety, cultural practices, and handling practices. However, if one attempts to find a general reference or compilation of findings regarding this sub\u00ad ject area there seems to be few, if any, available. A survey of the literature does suggest that in the past few years research into specific factors which influence the sensory aspects of fruits and vegetables has increased significantly. This increased interest in sensory research and the renewed national awareness of the value of research into pre\u00ad and postharvest quality of fruits and vegetables prompted the Flavor Subdivision, Agricultural and Food Chemistry Division, American Chemical Society to sponsor a symposium entitled \"Sensory Evalua\u00ad tion of Fruits and Vegetables: Effect of Environment, Cultural Prac\u00ad tices and Variety\" during the 1982 meeting in Kansas City, Missouri."

      "Life in a rural village in Mauritania is hard on women. Tradition and Islamic religion are intertwined to reinforce strict gender roles. The husband is the protector and keeper; his word is law. While the men take their ease, the girls and women are off to the fields during the peanut planting and harvest season, walking five miles each way, and coming home with heavy burdens from the fields to prepare the family dinner. They carry the water, sweep the yard, wash the clothes, and care for the children. This short, beautifully filmed video captures succinctly the subservience of women, while at the same time remaining respectful of tradition and culture. There are no drugs, alcohol or loneliness in this kind of community, where family bonds are very strong. We hear from several young Peace Corps workers in the village who are hopeful that by educating and thereby widening the horizons of young women, eventually women will have more choices. From a Western perspective, the future of Africa depends on education and family planning."

      "Weeds hold an enigmatic and sometimes-controversial place in agriculture, where they are generally reviled, grudgingly tolerated, and occasionally admired. In most cases, growers make considerable effort to reduce the negative economic impact of weeds because they compete with crops for resources and hinder field operations, thereby affecting crop productivity and quality, and ultimately the sustainability of agriculture. Weed control in production agriculture is commonly achieved through the integration of chemical, biological, and mechanical management methods. Chemicals (herbicides) usually inhibit the growth and establishment of weed plants by interfering with various physiological and biochemical pathways. Biological methods include crop competition, smother crops, rotation crops, and allelopathy, as well as specific insect predators and plant pathogens. Mechanical methods encompass an array of tools from short handled hoes to sophisticated video-guided robotic machines. Integrating these technologies, in order to relieve the negative impacts of weeds on crop production in a way that allows growers to optimize profits and preserve human health and the environment, is the science of weed management."

    "summary": [
      "Rhizoctonia Species: Taxonomy, Molecular Biology, Ecology, Pathology and Control, written by the world's most reputable experts in their respective fields of Rhizoctonia research, summarizes years of research in the various aspects of the ubiquitous complex group of soil-borne fungi belonging to the anamorph genus Rhizoctonia. Species of Rhizoctonia worldwide cause economically important diseases on most of the world's important plants such as cereals, potato, cotton, sugarbeet, vegetables, ornamentals and trees in nurseries. The subject reviews covered in the book include classic as well as modern approaches to Rhizoctonia research in: Taxonomy and Evolution, Genetics and Pathogenicity, Plant-Rhizoctonia Interactions, Ecology, Population and Disease Dynamics, Disease Occurrence and Management in Various Crops, Cultural Control, Biological Control, Germplasm for Resistance, Chemical and Integrated Control Strategies. It aims to be the standard reference source book on Rhizoctonia for the next decade or more, just as Parmeter et al. (1970) has been in the past. It will be an important publication for Rhizoctonia investigators, plant pathologists, students, extension specialists, crop producers and companies dealing with plant disease control."

      "New Trends in Allergy V\" is the fifth volume of a series focussing on new trends in experimental and clinical allergology. The interdisciplinary character is documented by articles from such different fields as basic immunology, chemistry, molecular biology, pharmacology, epidemiology, pneumology, dermatology, otolaryngology, pediatrics and psychosomatic medicine. Special emphasis is given to the role of both anthropogenic (pollutants) as well as natural environmental factors in the development of allergy. Among new pathophysiological concepts, dendritic cells, lymphocyte interactions, mast cells, eosinophils and neutrophils as well as psycho-neuro-immunological influences are featured. Practical aspects focus on asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, atopic eczema, occupational and food allergy as well as anaphylaxis. The most recent therapeutic strategies comprise novel pharmacotherapy and allergen-specific as well as unspecific (e. g. anti-IgE) immunotherapy."

      "Rapid changes and significant progress have been made in the use of Agrobacterium to genetically transform plants for both basic research purposes and agricultural development. In Agrobacterium Protocols, Second Edition, Volumes 1 and 2, a team of leading experts and veteran researchers describe in detail their best techniques for delivering DNA to plant cells and permanently altering their genomes. Volume 1 details the most updated techniques available for twenty-six plant species drawn from cereal crops, industrial plants, legume plants, and vegetable plants, and presents various methods for introducing DNA into three major model plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula, and Nicotiana. The authors also outline the basic methods in Agrobacterium manipulation and strategies for vector construction, major components of plant transformation that are often neglected by many plant biologists. Volume 2 contains another thirty-three proven techniques for root plants, turf grasses, woody species, tropic plants, nuts and fruits, ornamental plants, and medicinal plants. Additional chapters provide methods for introducing DNA into non-plant species, such as bacteria, fungi, algae, and mammalian cells. The protocols follow the successful Methods in Molecular Biology™ series format, each offering step-by-step laboratory instructions, an introduction outlining the principles behind the technique, lists of the necessary equipment and reagents, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Comprehensive and highly practical, Agrobacterium Protocols, Second Edition, Volumes 1 and 2 offers plant biotechnologists a gold standard collection of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation techniques for state-of-the-art plant genetic engineering, functional genomic analysis, and crop improvement, and for inspiration in developing new methods for other related and non-related plants."

      "From 12 April to 14 April 1988, 120 of Gerard and Antoinette de Vaucouleurs's friends and colleagues gathered at the Institut d' Astrophysique in Paris to cel\u00ad ebrate Gerard's 70th birthday and his remarkable career in Astronomy. The gathering also honored the memory of Antoinette (who died 29 August 1987 after a long illness) and her own no less remarkable career. This volume collects the 24 invited review papers and the 60 contributed poster papers presented at the meeting. Gerard de Vaucouleurs Gerard de Vaucouleurs was born on 25 April 1918 in Paris, where he spent his boyhood. He became an active amateur astronomer in the early 1930's, making extensive observations of Mars, Jupiter, and variable stars (including the bright supernova of 1937 in IC 4182). He also began life-long interests in astronomical photography and galaxy cataloguing during this period. In 1939, he met the director of the Paris transport system and an equally avid amateur astronomer, Julien Peridier. De Vaucouleurs worked at Peridier's private observatory at Le Houga in southwestern France on and off throughout the next decade. His undergraduate work was in mathematics, astronomy, and experimental physics; this, combined with his interest in observational astronomy, formed his life-long empirical approach to science. After spending 18 months in the French army early in 1939 - 41, Gerard returned to the Peridier observatory and then, in 1943, to his studies at the Sorbonne, where he met Antoinette."

      "Oilseeds and legumes provide a significant proportion of the protein and energy requirements of the world population. This important new book provides comprehensive details of the main oil seed and legume crops focusing particularly on the nutritional aspects of these crops which are, or have the potential to be, more widely exploited in developing countries where are or have the potential to be, more widely exploited in developing countries where protein and energy malnutrition continue to escalate. The predicted rapid rise of populations in many world regions which are increasingly vulnerable to food shortages means that a full knowledge of the nutritional significance of available crops is vital in helping to prevent potential calamities. Food and Feed from Legumes and Oil Seeds has been written by a team of international contributors, each with direct experience of these important crops and their nutritional merits, and the editors are both international experts in the crops covered. This book will become of great value to nutritionists, food and feed scientists and technologists, agricultural scientists and all those involved with overseas developments and food aid organizations."

      "Moving to a new country and learning the ways of a new culture is often a long and difficult process. Add learning how to parent to this task, and you have a whole new experience for these expatriates. Yolande and Marie are two French moms learning how to raise their children to live in Southern California. Their counterparts, Heather, Dana, and Jason, are all Americans attempting the same task but in Paris, France. Peanut Butter et Confiture follows five expatriate parents on their individual journeys of learning to parent like the locals do. Each expat is at a different stage of acculturation and assimilation, and some are more expert expat parents than others. From struggling with the French language and suffering from parenting guilt, to learning how to deal with a sassy American seven-year-old, Yolande, Marie, Heather, Dana, and Jason are all learning as they go, and being raised by their foreign children along the way."

    "summary": [
      "The recent series of texts 'Developments in Food Proteins' comprised in all seven volumes which were published in the course of the decade 1982-1991. Each volume contained inter alia one or more chapters that were concerned with new or developing sources of food proteins. Most of these have now been collected together in an up\u00ad dated and re-evaluated form for the present volume. 'New' sources of food proteins includes those sources that are unconventional, that are still of very limited significance in market terms, or that are at present of very localized use. Several of these were included in 'Developments in Food Proteins'. One of them, algae, appeared both in Volume 1 and in an up-dated form in Volume 7. It is therefore not included here. Others, such as yeasts and bacteria, have not yet increased in practical importance as potential food components beyond the long-term promise already evident at that time. However, leaf protein, as described in the present Chapter 10, has moved from the original rather crude concept to a much more sophisticated product in the form of Rubisco. Fungal protein, as Quorn (Chapter 11), has also proved to be potentially of real food value. 'Developing' sources of food protein are those sources that have always been basic items in human diets."

      "This second edition volume expands on the previous edition with new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in allergy through the use of various protocols that cover disciplines like allergy, immunology, cell biology, and histology. The chapters in this book cover topics such as characterization of allergens using western blotting and mass spectrometry, collecting and sampling airborne allergens, IgG antibodies, identification and characterization of allergen specific T cells, and the role of antigen presenting cells in T cell proliferation. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Cutting-edge and thorough, Allergy: Methods and Protocols, Second Edition is a valuable resource for researchers interested in beginning or continuing their research in the study of allergies."

    "summary": [
      "Chemical changes that occur in foods during processing and storage are manifold and might be both desirable and undesirable in nature. While many of the processes are carried out intentionally, there are also certain unwanted changes that naturally occur in food and might have to be controlled. Therefore, efforts are made to devise processing technologies in which desirable attributes of foods are retained and their deleterious ef\u00ad fects are minimized. While proteins, lipids and carbohydrates are the main nutrients of food that are affected by processing, it is their interaction with one another, as well as in\u00ad volvement oflow-molecular-weight constituents that affects their flavor, color and overall acceptability. Thus, generation of aroma via thermal processing and bioconversion is of utmost importance in food preparation. Furthermore, processing operations must be opti\u00ad mized in order to eliminate or reduce the content of antinutrients that are present in foods and retain their bioactive components. Therefore, while novel processing technologies such as freezing, irradiation, microwaving, high pressure treatment and fermentation might be employed, control process conditions in a manner that both the desirable sensory attributes and wholesomeness of foods are safeguarded is essential. Obviously, method\u00ad ologies should also be established to quantitate the changes that occur in foods as a result of processing. This volume was developed from contributions provided by a group of internation\u00ad ally-recognized lead scientists."

The cases are explored from pre-crisis, mid-crisis, and post-crisis perspectives, and include a range of predominant crisis scenarios from product recalls to lawsuits to environmental disasters. Exercises are included to help students apply concepts from crisis communication and management such as crisis threat assessment and the utility of social media in scanning for crisis warning signs.

      "The articles collected here are foundational contributions to integrating behavioural research and risk analysis. They include seminal articles on three essential challenges. One is ensuring effective two-way communication between technical experts and the lay public, so that risk analyses address lay concerns and provide useful information to people who need it. The second is ensuring that analyses make realistic assumptions about human behaviours that affect risk levels (e.g., how people use pharmaceuticals, operate equipment, or respond to evacuation orders). The third is ensuring that a"

    "summary": [
      "Many agricultural crops worldwide, especially in semi-arid climates, suffer from iron deficiencies. Among plants sensitive to iron deficiency are apples, avocado, bananas, barley, beans, citrus, cotton, grapes, peanuts, pecans, potatoes, sorghum, soybeans, and numerous ornamental plants. Deficiencies are usually recognized by chlorotic, in new leaves and are typically found among sensitive crops grown in calcareous or yellowed, interveinal areas soils which cover over 30% of the earth's land surface. Iron deficiency may lead, in extreme cases, to complete crop failure. In intensive agriculture on calcareous soils, iron often becomes a major limiting nutrient for optimal crop production, thus, correction of iron deficiency is required. Various chemicals and practices are available. They are, however, costly and do not always result in a complete remedy of the deficiency. Crucial questions relative to the cost-benefit equation such as the recovery rate of plants and the long-term fertilizing effect have not yet been resolved. The complexity of iron nutrition problems requires an understanding of the chemistry of iron oxides in soils, of the chemistry of both natural and synthetic chelates, of rhizosphere microbiology and biochemistry, and of the physiological involvement of the plant in iron uptake and transport."
