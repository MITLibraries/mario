      "In A Common Table, Two Red Bowls blogger Cynthia Chen McTernan shares more than 80 Asian-inspired, modern recipes that marry food from her Chinese roots, Southern upbringing, and Korean mother-in-law's table. The book chronicles Cynthia's story alongside the recipes she and her family eat every day--beginning when she met her husband at law school and ate out of two battered red bowls, through the first years of her legal career in New York, to when she moved to Los Angeles to start a family. As Cynthia's life has changed, her cooking has become more diverse. She shares recipes that celebrate both the commonalities and the diversity of cultures: her mother-in-law's spicy Korean-inspired take on Hawaiian poke, a sticky sesame peanut pie that combines Chinese peanut sesame brittle with the decadence of a Southern pecan pie, and a grilled cheese topped with a crisp fried egg and fiery kimchi. And of course, she shares the basics: how to make soft, pillowy steamed buns, savory pork dumplings, and a simple fried rice that can form the base of any meal. Asian food may have a reputation for having long ingredient lists and complicated instructions, but Cynthia makes it relatable, avoiding hard-to-find ingredients or equipment, and breaking down how to bring Asian flavors home into your own kitchen. Above all, Cynthia believes that food can bring us together around the same table, no matter where we are from. The message at the heart of A Common Table is that the food we make and eat is rarely the product of one culture or moment, but is richly interwoven--and though some dishes might seem new or different, they are often more alike than they appear. -- Amazon."

      "This paper proposes a hybrid electronic and magnetic structure that enables transformers with “fractional” and reconfigurable turns ratios (e.g. 12:0.5, 12:1, 12:2). This functionality is valuable in converters with wide operating voltage ranges and high step-up/down, as it offers a means to reduce copper loss within the transformer while also facilitating voltage doubling and quadrupling. We introduce the principle of operation of the structure and present models for its magnetic and electrical behaviour. An experimental prototype capable of accommodating a widely varying input (120-380[subscript Vdc]) and output (5, 9, 12V) validates the operating principle and modelling of the proposed structure and achieves conversion efficiencies between 93.4% and&#13; 95.7% at 25-36 W."

          "Charles J. Connick (1875-1945) was an American stained glass artist whose work may be found in cities all across the United States. Connick's works in the Arts and Crafts movement and beyond uniquely combined ancient and modern techniques and also sparked a revival of medieval European stained glass craftsmanship. Connick studied symbols and the interaction between light, color and glass, as well as the crucial connection between the stained glass window and its surrounding architecture.",
          "Connick founded his own studio in 1912 in Boston. The Charles J. Connick Studio performed work for churches, synagogues, schools, hospitals, public buildings and private homes in cities across the United States and in several other countries. When Connick died in 1945, the worker-owned studio continued as Charles J. Connick Associates under the supervision of Orin E. Skinner in Boston's Back Bay until closing in 1987.",
          "The Charles J. Connick Stained Glass Foundation was created to preserve the Connick tradition of stained glass. At the same time, items from the studio were donated to the Boston Public Library's Fine Arts Department to form Charles J. Connick Studio Collection. In 2008, the Foundation donated its own collection of stained glass windows, designs, cartoons, slides, documents, periodicals, and other items to the MIT Libraries. The collection was processed over three years from March 2009 to May 2012."
